as the last echoes of that horrid 
scream fade away in the distance,  
you pick a teleport at random hoping 
it will bring you back to daedalon, 
or at least the overworld.  
     
but even if that doesn't work out, 
you feel no remorse.
     
with the shadow of korax vanquished,
the world is now safe from evil.
