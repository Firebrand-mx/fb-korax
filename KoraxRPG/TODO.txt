----------- CLASSES --------------------------------------

	Think which of the LinkedLists could be replaced by array type (even all of them?)

	Pawn classes suck. :( Either return Pawn class (derive from IA) or do not use these at all.?

	Tables of class-specific constants for pawns, like exps? base behavior params - to use less memory for IAs


----------- GUI -----------------------------------------

	'Back'  option in each submenu - primarily to use mouse on them.
	(A graphic maybe?)

	Use RMB to do 'back' in menus

----------- GAMEPLAY ------------------------------------

	perhaps some experimental child classes, like Spike Spawner (from SpellInstance);

	"Jaw-Gate" action special (copy behavior from Unholy Heritage's map 10 revised) - could be useful


----------- AI ------------------------------------------

	NoWanderDuringAttack and EvadeMelee flags for IA behavior	- >> EvadeMelee done
	Perhaps divide IA behavior into 2 structs, with Route-specific params separated
	Evade routine for IA (even in Actor maybe)			- ?


	Behavior Packages (!!) + action specials to construct and apply them
