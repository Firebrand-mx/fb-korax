Description             : A detailed single player only level for Hexen.
			  Some devious puzzles as well as loads of action. 
			  A huge outdoor desert area, with a fort,
                          a castle, a well, a tower and lots of dungeons
                          and cultist places.
                          It would have been a staggering cripple on the
                          486 DX2 66 I had when Hexen came out.
                          On a Pentium, it's smooth, though.

			  There are no truly secret secrets 
			  in this level.
