                          the creation of this map, Raven Software for making
                          great modifications of the engine, and id Software,

Description             : I created this back in 1997 as an experiment to learn
                          the new features of Hexen. As you can tell by the
                          rather square nature of the map, I started playing
                          with Hexen right after I finished WATRCITY.WAD for
                          Heretic.

                          The map consists of a central icey area which
                          branches out and expands as you proceed to hit
                          switches, though there aren't that many. I made
                          this to learn many of the features present in the
                          original MAP39, so there are one or two things
                          (such as the crushers) which should only kill you
                          if you're really crazy and run under one. :)

                          I'll admit, this level is short, hard, and not
                          for everyone. Try playing not only on varying skill
                          levels, but also with different classes. It's
                          considerably harder to complete with the Fighter
                          then it is with the Cleric, and the Mage has a fair
                          time due to his distance weapons. The enemies vary
                          by class too, so bear that in mind as well.

                          This makes a great DM map, as there's a nice amount
                          of supplies but not too much to make any one class
                          overbearing. It's hilarious to see an enemy chase
                          after you with a much more powerful weapon, only to
                          be frozen solid by the ice shards in the central
                          area of the map. Use this section to your advantage!

                          Finally, thanks to the freaky numbering in the retail
                          Hexen maps, this is MAP39 but you'll need to do a
                          "-warp 30" on the command line, NOT "-warp 39".

 PLAY INFORMATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Special Features        : The WAD includes a new MAPINFO lump which simply
                          changes the sky and map name. This isn't needed, but
                          is recommended as the default is for a lightning
                          sky and the sectors aren't set up for "realistic"
                          lighting effects.
