Misc. Author Info       : This is my first Hexen level that I have made
                          public.  I take time when creating my levels,
                          paying close attention to texture alignment, use
                          of lighting, etc. so that my levels look as good
                          as they possibly can.

Description             : A single player and multiplayer .wad for Hexen.
                          You must make your way through the 'city'
                          to find the switches that will open the gate and
                          lower the pillar giving access to the FlameMask.
                          Once the gate is open, you will then make your way
                          down the path to the final building.  Do you have
                          what it takes to complete it?

                          In multiplayer deathmatch mode there are several
                          doors that open up corridors connecting the main
                          buildings.  This has the benefit of making a more
                          "spider-web" level that is better for deathmatching.

                          A LOT of time went into creating this level.  It
                          is almost 300k, and the scripts alone total over
                          300 lines.  I tried to cover a lot of ground with
                          this level to try to demonstrate different scripts.
                          If you see anything you like in here and want to
                          know how I did it, just E-Mail me and I will either
                          try to explain it, or send you a copy of my script.
                          (Check out the Highlander effects when you kill the
                          big bad guy. :)
