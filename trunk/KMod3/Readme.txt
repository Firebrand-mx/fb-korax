Korax Mod 3.0
-------------

This version of KMod changes the gameplay in a greater way than KMod2.0 - 2.8 did
and as such was numbered version 3.0.

This code is incompleate as I've lost the motivation to continue with this line
of KMod and I will now be moving to far greater projects for Korax' Heritage using
the Vavoom engine.


Changes
-------

- The new 5 attribute experience system.
- 2 Non-playable characters (NPC) have been added, the Old Mage and Cleric.
- An incompleate Journal, including Enemy and Item descriptions, Map (intended),
  Quest Page (Not even remoatly compleate), a player statistics page.
- Spell book, both very incompleate and disabled.
- Support for higher base resolutions.
- Mages Defencive and Repulsion spells have changed places.
- The Ice wand for the Mage.
- A hammer that doesn't use mana for the Fighter.
- Conversation system.
- Multiple forgotten bug fixes.
