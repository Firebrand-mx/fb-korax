                          (see home-page under http://www.electricpages.com/tmin
                          for sound bites and pics, etc...) Author of 
                          AlienV, Helrzor, and AL|EN QUAKE (current project)
                          and this Hexen wad plus about a bazillion other 
                          ones that I never uploaded :)
                          
Description             : A five level hub for HEXEN, which is not entirely
                          completed, though it is playable, and has lots of
                          cool scripts and poly's and other cool stuff.  I
                          made this just before QTEST came out, and sort of
                          lost interest once QUAKE was released.  I did spend
                          a lot of time on this and didn't want to see it go
                          to waste, so here it is, and anyone who wants to
                          use it, or complete it is welcome to do so...For 
                          the most part, it looks finished, but there were
                          some things that I wanted to do but never got 
                          around to - plus if I didn't have all of the 
                          doors locked with keys that were supposed to be 
                          or something.

                          Nicole for not asking to many questions about
                          why I would make sick levels like this :)
