Thanks to                 :HGoodson for the test runs and the constructive
input. (And the                                     solution on those poly
doors).

                                Brijore for letting me check out his Hexen
levels (man, they gave                                    me some great
ideas!) Also thanks for the pointers.

                                And thanks to Khalad5131. Man, is there
anything he dosen't                                        know?

                                Raven & ID for this awesome stretch of the
DOOM engine.

Oh hell, I certainly can't stop you from doing whatever the heck you want
with this wad. So, go for it!
===============================================================

This is the first four levels of a projected 8-level wad. All the rage right
now seems to be in Deathmatch levels, but I didn't plan or design these
levels with Deathmatch in mind. I wanted something like a high-octane
adventure for single play or cooperation mode. Just a big, long trek through
interesting but dangerous levels, with exploration and puzzle-solving in the
fore-front. Although blood-thirsty monsters and painful deaths are not
overlooked.

I wanted levels that didn't require all the hopping and warping around like
the main Hexen IWAD did. One of the things that irked me most about the main
Hexen IWAD was the overabundance of going back and forth over the same levels
looking for some switch to pull to change something else in another hub
you've already been to many times before. It made the levels get old very
fast.

In the Krull.wad you travel on a journey of revenge from a mountain
stronghold to deep within the mountain, to a river valley guarded by a
wyvern, to a mine tunnelling under a great rift.

This is an ongoing project for me, and I have a few more levels to add yet.
