* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
Build Time              : almost a month
Editor(s) used          : DCK 3.62, DEEP 8.20, WARM 1.6 & ZENNODE .98a
Known Bugs              : none now, except for repeating sky texture at
                             castle entrance when you see it from jumping
                             or high up, but it couldn't be helped, as far
                             as I know (e-mail me if you have any idea how
                             to fix)


* Recommendations *

I designed this level on a 486/33 and it didn't run too well, but I tried
it on my friend's Pentium 100 and it kicked ass, as it should. I'd suggest
maybe at least a 486/75 or somewhere along those lines. This level would
be good for deathmatch or coop, but it's harder than hell on single player.
Don't say I didn't warn ya!


* Copyright / Permissions *

Authors MAY use this level as a base to build additional levels,
but give me some credit somewhere in your .TXT file, and send me
a copy of your new wad, or at least let me know where to check it out.
