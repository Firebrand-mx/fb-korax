Misc. Author Info       : I am currently working on a multi-level "episode"
                          for Hexen.  However, due to the enormous response
                          of my previous Hexen level, HXCOD1.WAD I have
                          decided to upload the levels as I create them and
                          perhaps upload a compilation (though with some
                          changes to the previously released levels) at a
                          later date.  I take time when creating my levels,
                          paying close attention to texture alignment, use
                          of lighting, etc. so that my levels look as good
                          as they possibly can.

Description             : A single player and multiplayer .wad for Hexen.
                          You must go in and retake the castle.  Be warned,
                          however, this task will not be easy.  The castle is
                          well stocked with troops, and there is a Wyvern
                          keeping guard over it.  You must find the switches
                          to reveal the exit.  You must pay attention at all
                          times.  Your life depends on it.

Known Bugs              : Just the usual ones you get when you have a giant
                          open area.  However, as long as you don't cheat and
                          go to the other side of the moat, you shouldn't
                          have any problems.  Every now and then the Wyvern
                          gets stuck on something.  He'll usually correct
                          himself.
