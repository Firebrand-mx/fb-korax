----------------- CURRENTLY NEEDED STUFF ---------------------

Setup:
- Teams should be always fixed (configured in mm) [CW]<--Done

Teams:
- Create them before load level (is this really possible?) [CW]<--Done

Game Objects:
- Colored Decors with Static Lights on them should have their Team light set when map is loaded (this requires Team created before game starts and fixed Teams). [CW]<--Done

Generic sounds:
- sounds for picking up important items, like PI damage, Boots of Speed and Shadow Sphere

CTF:
- More music/sounds: Alert (flag captured) and lost flag recover

Happenings:
- If player poisons another player and then dies BEFORE posioned player leaving existing corpse (e.g. as Ice Statue),
and THEN poisoned player dies while killer corpse still present, KArenaPlayerPawn::IsDeathInflictor can not work properly. This needs some idea...

Cosmetics:
- all announcements should be displayed not by common text but by specific icons with custom text, i.e. splashes
(trophy icons already made by DoomJedi) and voice

Localization:
- search all progs for hard-coded text strings and use localization instead

Configs:
- Move Powerups into separate Powerups group; Health & Mana (Ammo) should be all separate; Move Bot Path Nodes to separate group


------------------------ DEFERRED ----------------------------

- CTFBanners and Colored Decor must be translated in progs, not ACS

---------------------- FUTHER IDEAS --------------------------

Bots:
-  write enhanced AI version (easy to say :P)
- Weapons: safe distance, effective distance for bots.
- Bot infos should be read from script, as teams do (BOTINFO)

Game Objects:
- Randomized pickups

Game Models:
- Serpent Race
- Assault
- Summoning
etc... will need ehnanced bot ai perhaps

Cosmetics:
- show some signs over allies to distinguish them quickly?

Menu:
- show available bots list for Add and Remove Bot options.
