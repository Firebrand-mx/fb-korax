------------------------ CRITICAL ----------------------------

- think about deriving KArenaPlayerPawn from KArenaActor (???? <- wtf?)

- check BotPlayer's ChooseBlastRadiusMode and ChoosePoisonBagMode, they do not look like they do anything at all
 (only some checks are made in there)
- BotPlayer still need some fixes, for example enemy distancing is bad; also they have to know not to try pickup
items that are already at max amount.


- Dom Sigil !!!
- CTFBanners and decor must be translated n progs, not ACS


- Final scoreboard - move Score & Ctrl columns right a bit



-----------------------------------------          CURRENTLY NEEDED STUFF          -------------------------------------------


- All weapon classes should have names like WeaponPlayerClassNameWeaponName. Check for unused weapons once again.
- Weapons: safe distance, effective distance for bots - check all.
- Loading screens: support for random graphic; support for game mode special texts.




- new implementation for intermission (scoreboard, teleport to maps from game mode list)  <-- [CW] Done?

- make bot check Z range when doing CanReach <- [FB] Done
  what about 3d floors? <--  [FB] Partially Done

- make ALL player shot missiles and spawned objects (clouds, rain) always set Target equal to PInstigator.MO before doing any damage (Is this possible?)

- use monster names in Orbituaries (not that critical, but useful) <-- [CW] Done?

- make bots not attack player when he is unvulnerable (has invuln-ty power), since it is senseless.
  OR pobably make this behavior depend on bot's skill? i.e. if bot is dumb, he should attack, elsewise he should not

- Team Player starts - that allow to spawn only players that belong to corresponding team. May be useful for CTF primarily.

- make PI DAMAGE icon be drawn in different place (right-upper corner maybe); in its curent position it is often becomes covered by game messages;
 also it needs some animation like artifacts in Hexen have to draw user attention; add some sound and announcement on pickup?

- replace static arrays by array class where possible (? still needed?)

----------------------------------------- IDEAS, PERHAPS FOR NEXT RELEASE (v. 1.1) -------------------------------------------

- all announcements should be displayed not by common text but by specific icons with custom text, i.e. splashes
(trophy icons already made by DoomJedi)

- make 'don't shoot' icon to be shown when player is targetting at ally - [FB] Couldn't we just use different text colours for this (red enemy / green ally)?

- show available bots list for Add and Remove options.
