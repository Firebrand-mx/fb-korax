Extract this zip in your DB2/Configurations folder. Allow it to overwrite content in the Includes subfolder.
Then go to the vavoom subfolder for the configurations you want to use, and move or copy them in the
Configurations folder. Do not move them all! There are so many that DB2 would become sluggish and unresponsive
on start up and when opening a map. Just move those you need, and move them back when you don't need them
anymore.


This configurations are based on those provided for ZDoom compatible engines by Gez. You can adapt them for your
custom games if you read the template for configurations included with this distribution. Enjoy!


NOTE: It's safe to overwrite the contents of the Include folder of these config distribution with what's
included here, it won't break any of the configurations you already have setup.
