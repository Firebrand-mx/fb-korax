- make self-aiming weapons not target allies
- make bots not attack player when he is unvulnerable (has invuln-ty power), since it is senseless.
  OR pobably make this behavior depend on bot's skill? i.e. if bot is dumb, he should attack, elsewise he should not
- make player not ready weapon after pickup if he hasn't enouph mana to fire it (8th weapon is it) since this makes him
 loose some time to reselect weapon.



----------------------------------------- IDEAS, PERHAPS FOR NEXT RELEASE (v. 1.1) -------------------------------------------

- all announcements should be displayed not by common text but by specific icons with custom text, i.e. splashes
(trophy icons already made by DoomJedi)
- make 'don't shoot' icon to be shown when player is targetting at ally

- show available bots list for Add and Remove options.

- Team Player starts - that allow to spawn only players that belong to corresponding team. May be useful for CTF primarily.
