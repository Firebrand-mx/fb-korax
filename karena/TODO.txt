------------------------ CRITICAL ----------------------------

- BotPlayer still need some fixes, for example enemy distancing is bad.

- Dom Sigil !!! (Bug reported at Vavoom forums)

- CTFBanners and decor must be translated in progs, not ACS

- In Final scoreboard, move Score & Ctrl columns right a bit <-



-----------------------------------------          CURRENTLY NEEDED STUFF          -------------------------------------------


- All weapon classes should have names like WeaponPlayerClassNameWeaponName. Check for unused weapons once again.

- Weapons: safe distance, effective distance for bots - check all.

- Loading screens: support for random graphic; support for game mode special texts.

- make ALL player shot missiles and spawned objects (clouds, rain) always set Target equal to PInstigator.MO before doing any damage (Is this possible?)

- use monster names in Orbituaries (not that critical, but useful) <-- [CW] Done?

- make bots not attack player when he is unvulnerable (has invuln-ty power), since it is senseless.
  OR pobably make this behavior depend on bot's skill? i.e. if bot is dumb, he should attack, elsewise he should not

- make PI DAMAGE icon be drawn in different place (right-upper corner maybe); in its curent position it is often becomes covered by game messages;

- also it needs some animation like artifacts in Hexen have to draw user attention;

- add some sound and announcement on pickup?

- replace static arrays by array class where possible (? still needed?)

----------------------------------------- IDEAS, PERHAPS FOR NEXT RELEASE (v. 1.1) -------------------------------------------

- all announcements should be displayed not by common text but by specific icons with custom text, i.e. splashes
(trophy icons already made by DoomJedi)

- make 'don't shoot' icon to be shown when player is targetting at ally - [FB] Couldn't we just use different text colours for this (red enemy / green ally)?

- show available bots list for Add and Remove options.
