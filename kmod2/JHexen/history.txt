* Doomsday updated to work with JHeretic

Version 0.99.2
--------------
+ sounds can be resampled to 22 or 44 kHz and/or 16 bits (the original sounds
  are 8 bit/11 kHz, so don't expect any miracles) in the Sound menu

- when console opens, all actions will stop
- slightly faster texture loading 
- the black console edge is in the right place

D3D renderer:
+ option -badtexalpha: use more bits for texture color, less for alpha

- far clip distance moved farther (Seven Portals end ravine rendered 
  correctly)

  is actually used)
